# Data-Wrangling
Ive been taking the course of Data Analysis using Python from Coursera and uploaded one of the workbooks on data wrangling. This workbook explains how to  format, normalize data and the techniques used in identifying missing data. Also, the concept of binning has been introduced in this workbook.
